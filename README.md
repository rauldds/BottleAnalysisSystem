# Bottle Analysis System
The use of artificial vision is a common practice within large industries, however, in small industries, it is necessary to develop a customized system, because it must adjust to the needs of the small producer, who must take special care of the quality of his products. The possibility of developing a quality control system for a small bottling plant based on artificial vision was evaluated. The resources used were 2 webcams, a small black background room, a controlled light system and MatLab as software. As a result, a system capable of extracting images taken by webcams was obtained, these were then analyzed to determine the filling level, the presence of dents and the concentration of the water in the bottles.
